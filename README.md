# UR Way Egalite Baccarat Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a Python script for analyzing the vulnerability of the "UR Way Egalite" (UWE) side bet in baccarat to card counting techniques. It highlights the potential for profit through both individual and coordinated team efforts, based on detailed statistical analysis and simulations.

## How It Works
The script simulates various betting scenarios on the UWE side bet, calculating the house edge and the effectiveness of different card counting systems for each of the ten possible tie bets. It provides a detailed analysis of the edge achievable under optimal conditions, demonstrating how players can gain a significant advantage.

## Requirements
